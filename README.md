# React Native Bug

This repo is a small sample app to demonstrate a potential bug in React Native

## Usage

  * Download repo
  * Open file `ReactBug.xcodeproj`
  * Run app in simulator
    * *NOTE: I added `node_modules` to the repo so you don't need to `npm install`*
  * Click on a card
  * Notice the CPU spike
